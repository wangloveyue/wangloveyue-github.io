Happy birthday my dear YUE. This is a birthday gift for you. Hoping you can keep health and happy every day. We have already get through a lot, and we believe in each other. I love you much more than anything else even myself. I will protect you. 
I know I have many disadvantages(just like this simple website), but I will try my best to overcome them and give you a dreamful life.

Yours, 
Haoran
